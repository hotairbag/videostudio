**Seedance 1.5 pro Prompt Guide**

**1\. Model Introduction & Highlights**

**1.1 Introduction**

Seedance 1.5 Pro is a foundational model purpose-built for **native, joint audio-video generation**. It adopts a dual-branch Diffusion Transformer architecture, combining a cross-modal fusion module with a specialized multi-stage data pipeline to deliver exceptional audio-visual synchronization and high-quality outputs.

**1.2 Highlights**

- **High-precision audio-visual synchronization:** Delivers high-fidelity, fully integrated audio-visual outputs, supporting a wide range of sound types including environmental sounds, action effects, synthesized audio, musical instruments, background music, and vocals.
- **Multi-person and multi-language dialogue:** Supports both monologues and multi-speaker conversations with millisecond-level lip-sync precision. The model covers Mandarin and major Chinese dialects (including Cantonese,Shaanxi and Sichuan), as well as English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Indonesian, faithfully capturing the natural rhythm, articulation, and realism of real-world conversations.
- **Film- and television-grade narrative tension:** Delivers natural motion ranges with strong rhythmic flow and precise capture of motion details. The visuals exhibit high perceptual impact, with nuanced rendering of character emotions and expressions, significantly enhancing vividness and achieving a cinematic, film- and television-grade creative texture.

As a result, when writing prompts, users can be more explicit and expressive in describing **dialogue content, language choices, emotional progression, camera movement, and narrative structure**. The model is able to understand these elements holistically and generate audio and visuals in a coordinated, simultaneous manner, making it well suited for professional creative scenarios with high audio-visual consistency requirements, such as advertising, short-form drama, and character-driven storytelling.

**2.General Prompting Tips**

**Prompt formula:Subject + Movement+Environment (optional) + Camera movement (optional) + Aesthetic description (optional) + Sound (optional)**

**2.1 Basic principles**

**_One-sentence summary:Use concise and precise language to describe only the essential elements needed for generation._**

**Tip1: Describe necessary information**

| **Do** | **Don't** |
| --- | --- |
| Provide clear, constrained descriptions of the **subject** and **motion** to supply essential information for video generation and help the model better understand the core scene.<br><br>**\[Seedance_V1.5_pro_int4(Seed内场终版）\_LLM_一个面容沧桑、身穿中世纪海盗服饰的男子站在大海边黑色的礁石上。男子的表情富有激情，他向天空有力的举起双手，动作透露出对自由的渴望.mp4\]**<br><br>T2v: A man with a weathered face and dressed in medieval pirate costumes stands on the black reef by the sea . The man's expression is passionate , and he raises his hands powerfully toward the sky, revealing a desire for freedom. | Lacks clear subject and motion, leaving the generation overly unconstrained and driven by the model's default behavior.<br><br>**\[Seedance_V1.5_pro_int4(Seed内场终版）\_LLM_主角向天空举手，展现对自由的渴望。.mp4\]**<br><br>t2v: the protagonist raises hands toward the sky |
| For the same scenario-"the protagonist raises hands toward the sky"-the prompt on the left provides clear constraints on the protagonist's appearance, actions, and scene context, while the prompt on the right omits this information. As a result, the video generated from the left prompt aligns more closely with the intended theme. |     |
| Specify the key visual cues the scene should convey<br><br>**\[Seedance_V1.5_pro_int4(Seed内场终版）\_LLM_狂风暴雨中，海面上卷起巨大的海浪。海水冲进城市，撞毁岸边的房屋。数以百计的市民惊恐地逃跑。最终海啸淹没一切。.mp4\]**<br><br>T2v: In a violent storm, huge waves rolled up on the sea. The seawater rushed into the city and destroyed houses on the shore . Hundreds of citizens fled in terror . Eventually, the tsunami engulfed everything. | Overuse of rhetorical language, resulting in redundant and unnecessary information.<br><br>**\[Seedance_V1.5_pro_int4(Seed内场终版）\_LLM_海水以狂乱的姿态冲进城市，势不可挡的摧毁一切。末日当头，人们如蝼蚁般渺小，慌乱逃跑，相互倾轧。.mp4\]**<br><br>t2v: The seawater rushes into the city in a frenzy, irresistibly destroying everything. With the end of the world looming, people are as insignificant as ants, fleeing in panic and trampling on each other. |
| **For the same scenario-"a tsunami destroys a city"-the prompt on the left describes the severity of the tsunami through intuitive, directly observable visual cues, such as massive waves, houses crashing along the shoreline, and people fleeing in panic. In contrast, the prompt on the right relies on abstract and non-visual rhetoric, including phrases like "frenzied posture," "unstoppable," and "insignificant like ants." As a result, the video generated from the left prompt appears more realistic and better aligned with visual intuition and physical logic.** |     |
| Use degree adverbs effectively<br><br>**\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_玩偶先是缓慢旋转，随后她停止转动，面对镜头展现自己的可爱。.mp4\]**<br><br>I2v: The doll first rotates slowly , then she stops rotating and shows her cuteness in front of the camera. | Overly strict quantitative constraints on motion<br><br>**\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_玩偶旋转两圈，然后她偏头展示自己的展现自己的可爱。.mp4\]**<br><br>I2v: The doll rotates twice, then she tilts her head to show her cuteness. |
| **For the same scenario-"a rotating doll display"-the prompt on the right imposes overly strict constraints on the rotation motion, increasing the difficulty of execution and leading to inferior results. In contrast, the prompt on the left guides the model using degree adverbs, producing a smoother and more effective outcome.** |     |

**Tip2: Clearly described information**

| **Do** | **Don't** |
| --- | --- |
| Use feature-based descriptions to define the subject consistently across the prompt<br><br>**\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_EN_1_7995771292162.mp4\]**<br><br>Inside a small street-side restaurant, four people squeeze around a small table to eat: an Indian woman, a Black man, a white woman, and a Japanese man. Only drinks are placed on the table. The environment is noisy but warm, and the camera moves with a slight lateral slide.  <br>English dialogue:<br><br>Indian woman: "This place looks sketchy, but the food smells amazing."  <br>Black man: "That's always a good sign."  <br>White woman: "I'm starving, I don't even care anymore."  <br>Japanese man: "Let's just order. Worst case, we laugh about it later." | Reused, ambiguous, or inconsistent references to the subject.<br><br>**\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_EN_1_7993929561090.mp4\]**<br><br>Inside a small street-side restaurant, four people squeeze around a small table to eat, with only drinks placed on the table. The environment is noisy but warm, and the camera moves with a slight lateral slide.  <br>English dialogue:  <br>A: "This place looks sketchy, but the food smells amazing." B: "That's always a good sign."  <br>C: "I'm starving, I don't even care anymore."  <br>D: "Let's just order. Worst case, we laugh about it later." |
| **Consistent subject references lead to clearer multi-character interactions, while inconsistent phrasing results in misaligned outputs.** |     |
| The prompt accurately aligns with both the visual content and the audio.<br><br>**\[Seedance_V1.5_pro_int4(Seed内场终版）\_LLM_模特展示身上的旗袍，气质优雅，旗袍魅力十足。.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: A model gracefully showcases the cheongsam she is wearing, exuding elegance and highlighting the garment's refined allure. | The prompt contradicts the visual and audio content<br><br>**\[Seedance_V1.5_pro_int4(Seed内场终版）\_LLM_模特展示手中的折扇，气质优雅，折扇十分华丽。.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v：A model gracefully presents a folding fan in her hand, exuding elegance and highlighting the fan's ornate beauty. |
| **Using the same image as the first frame of the video, the prompt on the left requests the model to showcase a cheongsam, which does not conflict with the visual content of the first frame and therefore produces the expected result. In contrast, the prompt on the right asks the model to display a folding fan in hand-an element not present in the first frame-causing a visual inconsistency where the fan appears out of nowhere and leading to an output that does not meet expectations.** |     |

**2.2 Sound generation**

Seedance 1.5 supports native generation of **dialogue/voiceover, sound effects, and background music.**

**2.2.1 Dialogue/Voiceover**

**Tip 1: High voice timbre stability**

I'm not rushing you." | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8001454852866.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: In a restrained emotional state, with a low tone and a very slow speaking pace, say:  <br>"If you want an answer, listen carefully." | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8001454853378.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: In a forceful emotional state, with a firm tone and a fast speaking pace, say:  <br>"Stay sharp. We move when I decide." | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8001454854402.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: In a confident emotional state, with a clear tone and an even speaking pace, say:  <br>"I know exactly how we will handle this." |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **After fixing the Seed value in the parameter settings, describe the voice timbre in detail. Seedance 1.5 supports multiple emotional expressions, intonation patterns, and speech rates while maintaining the same underlying timbre.** |     |     |     |     |

**Tip 3: In dialogue scenarios, lip movements can be accurately matched to each character.**

| **Two-person dialogue** | **Multi-person conversation** |
| --- | --- |
| **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8005125237250.mp4\]**<br><br>t2v：In a warm, softly lit independent bookstore, two Americans-a, a man and a woman-stand shoulder to shoulder, flipping through the same book. The light falls across the pages and their faces.

Let's break it down."<br><br>White male: "Okay, let's start from the beginning." |
| **Accurately specify each character's personalized attributes (gender, age, clothing, actions).** |     |

**Tip4: Supports responsive voiceover**

| **Documentary** | **Commercial** |
| --- | --- |
| **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_EN_1_8005432460802.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: Generate a video with voiceover: A deep, calm male voice says, "In the vast silence of the universe, our world is but a fleeting moment. Yet, within it, life thrives against all odds." The scene should slowly transition from night to dawn, with the stars gradually disappearing and the sun rising from behind the mountains. | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_7993927929346.mp4\]**<br><br>Generate a video based on the input lipstick product keyframe image, keeping the appearance, proportions, and materials of both the lipstick and the model accurate and consistent, with no unnecessary elements added. The overall style is a high-end e-commerce beauty commercial, clean, refined, and premium in tone. The video consists of three continuous shots: in the first shot, the camera performs an extremely slow and smooth push-in to showcase the lipstick's overall appearance and design details, with a rich, saturated lipstick bullet under soft, stable diffused warm lighting and a clean, blurred background; in the second shot, the view cuts to a close-up of the model's face, with the model holding the lipstick near her face in a portrait-style composition, featuring natural, luminous skin tone and a calm, confident expression, centered and stable to emphasize the connection between the product and the wearer; in the third shot, the camera cuts to a close-up of the lipstick placed on a woman's tabletop, resting on a clean surface with a minimal surrounding environment, soft and delicate lighting, and a stable frame, reinforcing product texture and final brand recall. A clear, confident female commercial voice-over with a refined tone and moderate speaking pace is synchronized with the visuals, delivering the following lines: "Rich color. Smooth texture. One swipe delivers radiant lips. Lightweight, comfortable, and effortlessly elegant." |
| **Specify the voiceover explicitly in the prompt, and the model will recognize and generate it accordingly.**<br><br>**Seedance 1.5 supports fine-grained control over voiceover timbre, emotion, intonation, and speech rate-clear and precise descriptions are sufficient.** |     |

**2.2.2 Sound Effects (SFX)**

**Seedance 1.5 supports basic sound effect generation with direct audio-visual output.**

| **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_7784296440834.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: Based on this image, generate a video that shows the rain outside the window getting slightly heavier, raindrops merging into streams and flowing down the glass, and a pedestrian with an umbrella hurrying past outside the window. | **\[doubao-seedance-1-5-pro方舟版_CN_1_7831050554626.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: At dusk, a large fuel depot exploded, with a fireball soaring into the sky. |
| --- | --- |
| **Basic sound effects do not need to be explicitly specified-the model will automatically match them to the visuals.** |     |

**2.2.3 Background Music (BGM)**

**By default, Seedance 1.5 automatically generates background music that matches the prompt.**

| Tip 1: Prompt-driven pacing control | Tip 2: Music style control | Tip 3: Background music mood control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8005493865474.mp4\]**<br><br>t2v: A cartoon character is in the center of the screen. The background music is a snippet of a fast-paced pop song. The requirement is for this cartoon character to clap hands in time with the drumbeats of the music. | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_7779533966082.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: A grand epic aerial video, with the camera passing through the magnificent mountains shrouded in clouds and ancient castles, accompanied by a heart-stirring symphony as background music, featuring a theme melody full of strength and hope. | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_7784296435202.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: Gently brush one's fingers across the face of each person in the photo. The background music should be **a gentle, nostalgic, and melodious guitar or piano solo**, with a complex emotion of faint reminiscence intertwined with happiness, and a gentle touch of sadness about the passage of time beneath the warmth |

**2.3 Shot Transition Writing**

Tip1: Supports consistent style before and after camera switching

| **Realistic** | **Japanese Anime Style manga** | **Disney-style nimation** | **Pixar-Style Animation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8004412470530.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: The shot starts with a close-up of the cat food bowl. Then it cuts to the , which is a close-up of the cat's face. It doesn't approach immediately but quietly watches. Next, the shot cuts to the third shot, which is a medium close-up of the owner. She whispers, "This time it's a new one." Then the shot cuts to the fourth shot, returning to a close-up of the cat's side. It slowly approaches, lowers its head to sniff, and finally starts to eat. Finally, it cuts to a close-up of the owner. She softly says, "It seems to suit your taste." Finally, it cuts to a stable shot of the cat and the cat food in the same frame, with the pace slowing down. | **\[02176611584293500000000000000000000ffffac1548228c2bc3.mp4\]**<br><br>t2v：  <br>Shot 1  <br>Front-facing medium shot. A city sidewalk at night, with streetlights and neon softly blurred in the background. Two adults walk side by side in frame, anime-style. The woman stops; the man notices and stops as well. She steps slightly closer to him and says in a half-serious, half-clingy tone:「ねえ……さっきから、ちょっと遠くない？」<br><br>Shot 2  <br>Cut to a front-facing close-up of the man. He pauses for a moment, looks down at her, and replies with gentle resignation:「そんなことないよ。」<br><br>Shot 3  <br>Cut to a front-facing close-up of the woman. She takes a small step forward, closing the distance, and says with a light smile:「じゃあ、もう少し近く歩こ。」<br><br>Shot 4  <br>Cut back to a medium shot of both of them in frame. Their shoulders are almost touching. The man responds softly:「……はいはい。」<br><br>Shot 5 (Ending)  <br>Cut to a close-up of the woman's side profile. Streetlight falls across her face as she shows a satisfied smile and murmurs:「それでいいの。」<br><br>The camera settles naturally, a light night breeze passing through, with a relaxed, intimate, everyday mood. | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8004412471554.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: The shot begins with a medium shot of both characters in frame. The girl turns to look at the boy and says with a confident smile, "We can do this!" The scene cuts to a close-up of the boy as he replies hesitantly, "Are you sure?" The camera then cuts back to a medium close-up of the girl. She turns around and opens her arms, saying in a light, upbeat tone, "Of course! Because we've already come this far." The camera settles naturally with her movement, the mood bright and resolute. | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8069652663298.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: The shot opens on a medium shot of the father and son together. The boy lowers his head and says softly, "I just want to know if I disappointed you." After a brief silence, the father answers gently, "No." The scene then cuts to a close-up of the boy as he lifts his head. Finally, the camera cuts back to the father, who smiles and says, "I just worry you'd be disappointed in yourself first." |
| Seedance 1.5 is able to maintain stylistic consistency across shot cuts, making it unnecessary to elaborate on this basic principle. |     |     |     |

Tip2: Supports everse-shot editing for dialogue scenes.

| **Double** | **Three people** |
| --- | --- |
| **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8069652664066.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: The shot starts with a medium close-up of the detective, who says calmly, "You returned to that alley at 11:47, and that's no coincidence." The shot cuts to a close-up of the suspect, who gives a soft sneer, averts his gaze, and says, "Coincidences always seem well-planned in hindsight." The shot cuts back to an even closer close-up of the detective, whose expression visibly turns cold but remains silent, and the tension in the air intensifies with each cut. | **\[02176748982080100000000000000000000ffffac1544294bb024 (1).mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: The shot starts with a medium shot of the three people together. The short man glances at his watch and says, "It's about time."  <br>Then the shot cuts to the medium close-up of the girl in the middle. She frowns and replies, "Let's wait a little longer. They might arrive any minute."  <br>After that, the shot cuts to the third shot, a close-up of the tall man. He looks towards the end of the street, his tone calm yet impatient: "We've been waiting for a long time."  <br>Finally, the shot cuts back to the medium shot of the three people together. Their gazes briefly meet, and no one says a word. The atmosphere is awkward. |

Tip3: Supports responding to shot switching timing

An adult man stands alone by the window, holding a phone in his hand. The shot cuts to a medium shot, where he glances down at the phone screen, the light of which reflects on his face. The shot cuts to a close-up of his hand, with his finger pausing on the screen without pressing the send button. The shot cuts to a close-up of his profile, where he gently exhales and whispers, "I think I'll skip it." Finally, the shot cuts back to the medium-long shot, where he puts the phone in his pocket, turns away from the window, the room falls silent again, and the frame freezes. | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8004412473090.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: Shot 1: The shot starts with a medium-long shot from the rooftop, where two people stand together in the frame above the city illuminated by neon lights. The male character says, "This city eats people alive." Shot 2: The shot cuts to a close-up of the female character, who sneers and replies, "Only if you let it." Shot 3: The shot cuts back to a close-up of the male character, who turns to look at the other, his tone turns solemn: "You really think we can change it?" Shot 4: The shot cuts to a medium-close shot of the female character, who steps forward, the neon light dancing on her face, and firmly says, "No. But we can survive it." Shot 5: Finally, the shot cuts back to a medium shot of the two people together in the frame | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8006868142082.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v:<br><br>Shot 1:  <br>Medium shot.

Starting from the corner of her eye, her once delicate skin began to harden and bulge. Deep black dragon scales seemed to pierce through from beneath the skin, quickly spreading along the cheekbones towards the neck. Along with a small amount of dark red sparks spilling out from the gaps between the scales, half of her face completed the material transformation from human skin to hard dragon armor within two seconds. Dark Fantasy, Cthulhu style, body horror aesthetics, extremely realistic 8K material details. | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_7993912387842 (1).mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: The cat's front paws lightly grasped the ground, arching its back in a stretching motion as if preparing to take off. At the position of its shoulder blades, two golden optical flows burst forth. The optical flows quickly wove and extended in the air, materializing into a pair of huge, semi-transparent holographic wings. After the wings fully unfurled, with each gentle , countless glowing stardust particles would fall, twinkling in the backlight. Final Fantasy style, dreamy, Tyndall light effect, slow-motion display of the wing's texture details. | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8001469501954.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: She inadvertently gently touched the old Christmas ball with her finger, and instantly, the inside of the ball lit up with a soft golden light like snowflake crystals. This light spread out from the ball like ripples, and wherever it reached, tiny light spots condensed in the air. The light first wrapped around the girl's entire body, her clothes were reshaped into Christmas attire, and her makeup was delicate; at the same time, the Christmas tree grew from the ground, the colored lights lit up one by one, and snowflakes condensed and fell out of thin air outside the window. The entire scene transformed into a Christmas-themed bedroom | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8001469504002.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: The cat is wrapped in a soft and warm bubble halo, its body gradually elongating as it stands up. Its fur evolves into fluffy orange short hair, while its ears remain as cute cat ears, and its tail sways gently. Its clothing changes to a Japanese-style casual sweatshirt and skirt. Finally, it transforms into an anime-style girl with cat pupils and cat ears, making a "meow" gesture at the camera with a cute and playful expression. Please focus on depicting the cute continuity from the cat to the character's demeanor, with the transformation process being as soft and smooth as a marshmallow. | **\[Doubao-Seedance_V1.5-pro(方舟测试版)\_CN_1_8001469506050.mp4\]**<br><br>i2v: A warm beam of sunlight pierces through the dark clouds and shines precisely on the center point of the concrete wall. Taking the light spot as the center, the gray concrete surface instantly fades and softens. Fresh green moss and vines spread out wildly in all directions at the speed of time-lapse photography. Immediately afterwards, countless colorful wildflowers burst into bloom on the vines. In just a few seconds, the once lifeless wall transforms into a vertical sea of flowers swaying in the wind. Solarpunk, with a Ghibli content style, is full of vitality, and the colors instantly shift from dull gray to highly saturated splendor. |

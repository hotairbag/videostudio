callback_url string
Please fill in the callback notification address for the result of this generation task. When there is a status change in the video generation task, Ark will send a callback request containing the latest task status to this address.
The content structure of the callback request is consistent with the response body of Querying the information about a video generation task.
The status returned by the callback includes the following states:
queued: In the queue.
running: The task is running.
succeeded: The task is successful. (If the sending fails, that is, the information of successful sending is not received within 5 seconds, the callback will be made three times)
failed: The task fails. (If the sending fails, that is, the information of successful sending is not received within 5 seconds, the callback will be made three times)
expirednew：The task has timed out. This occurs when the task has remained in the running or queued status for longer than the allowed expiration duration. The expiration duration can be set via the execution_expires_after field.

return_last_frame Boolean Default value: false
true：Returns the last frame image of the generated video. After setting this parameter to true, you can obtain the last frame image by calling the Querying the information about a video generation task. The last frame image is in PNG format, with its pixel width and height consistent with those of the generated video, and it contains no watermarks. 
Using this parameter allows the generation of multiple consecutive videos: the last frame of the previously generated video is used as the first frame of the next video task, enabling quick generation of multiple consecutive videos. For specific calling examples, please refer to the tutorial.
false：Does not return the last frame image of the generated video.

service_tiernew string Default value: default
Modification to the service tier of submitted tasks is not supported.
Specifies the service tier for processing the current request.
default: Online inference mode. This tier has lower RPM and concurrency quotas (see Model List), suitable for latency-sensitive inference scenarios.
flex: Offline inference mode. This tier provides a higher TPD quota (see Model List) at 50% of the price of the online inference tier, suitable for scenarios where low inference latency is not a critical requirement.

execution_expires_afternew integer Default value: 172800
The task expiration threshold. Specifies the time (in seconds) after which a submitted task will expire, calculated from its created_at timestamp.
Default: 172800 seconds (48 hours)
Valid Range: [3600，259200]
Regardless of the chosen service_tier, it is recommended to set an appropriate value based on your business scenario. Tasks exceeding the threshold will be automatically terminated and marked as expired.

generate_audionew boolean 默认值 true
Only supported by Seedance 1.5 pro
Controls whether the generated video includes audio synchronized with the visuals.
true: The model outputs a video with synchronized audio. Seedance 1.5 pro can automatically generate matching voice, sound effects, or background music based on the prompt and visual content. It is recommended to enclose dialogue in double quotes. Example: A man stops a woman and says, "Remember, never point your finger at the moon."
false: The model outputs a silent video.

Text commands for models (optional) 
You can add --[parameters] after the text prompt to control the specifications of the output video, such as its aspect ratio, frame rate, and resolution.
The parameters and values supported are model-dependent. Please consult the Model Text Command Comparison for specific compatibilities. Inputs that do not adhere to the selected model's specifications will be either ignored or result in an error.

The acceptable values are model-dependent. Please consult the Model Text Command Comparison for specifics

ratio string Abbreviation: rt
Text-to-Video generally defaults to 16:9.
Image-to-Video generally defaults to adaptive. The default for video generation from reference images is 16:9.
For Seedance 1.5 pro, the default aspect ratio is adaptive.
The aspect ratio of the output video. Valid values:
16:9
4:3
1:1
3:4
9:16
21:9
adaptive: The optimal aspect ratio is automatically selected based on the uploaded image.
warning
For Seedance 1.5 pro’s text-to-video feature, setting the aspect ratio to adaptive means the model will intelligently select the most suitable dimensions based on your input prompt.
The actual aspect ratio of the generated video can be obtained from the ratio field returned by the Retrieve a video generation task API.
Corresponding Width and Height Pixel Values for Different Aspect Ratios
Note: When generating a video from an image, if the selected aspect ratio is inconsistent with that of the uploaded image, Ark will crop your image. The cropping will be centered. For detailed rules, please refer to the Image Cropping Rules.

duration integer Default value: 5 Abbreviation: dur
Choose either duration or frames; frames takes priority over duration. If you want to generate a video of an integer number of seconds, it is recommended to specify duration.
The duration of the output video. Unit: seconds. 
Value range: 2~12 snew
warning
Seedance 1.5 pro supports two methods for configuring video duration:
Specify a fixed duration: You may set any integer value within the range [4, 12] (in seconds).
Let the model decide: Set the duration to -1, and the model will autonomously select an appropriate video length (in whole seconds) within the [4, 12] range. The actual generated video duration can be obtained from the duration field returned by the  Retrieve a video generation task API. Please note that video duration is related to billing, so configure this setting carefully.

framesnew Integer Abbreviation: frames
Seedance 1.5 pro is not supported.
Choose either duration or frames; frames takes priority over duration. If you want to generate a video with a fractional second duration, it is recommended to specify frames.
Number of frames for the output video. By specifying the number of frames, you can flexibly control the length of the generated video, including videos with fractional second durations. Due to the value constraints of frames, only a limited number of fractional second durations are supported. You need to calculate the closest number of frames using the formula. 
Calculation formula: Number of Frames = Duration × Frame Rate (24).
Value range: Supports all integer values within the range [29, 289] that conform to the format 25 + 4n, where n is a positive integer.
For example: If you want to generate a 2.4-second video, the number of frames would be 2.4 × 24 = 57.6. Since 57.6 is not a valid value for frames, you must select the closest valid value. Calculated using the formula 25 + 4n, the closest valid number of frames is 57, and the actual duration of the generated video will be 57 / 24 = 2.375 seconds.

framepersecond  integer Default value: 24 Abbreviation: fps
The frame rate of the output video, which specifies the number of images displayed in the video per second. Valid values:
24

seed integer Default value: -1 Abbreviation: seed
The seed, which is an integer that controls the randomness of the output content. Valid values: integers within the range of [-1, 2^32-1].
warning
If the seed parameter is not specified or is set to -1, a random number is used.
Changing the seed value is a way to obtain different outputs for the same request. Using the same seed value for the same request generates similar but not necessarily identical outputs.

camerafixed boolean Default value: false Abbreviation: cf
The reference-image-to-video is not supported
Specifies whether to fix the camera. Valid values:
true: fixes the camera. The platform appends an instruction to fix the camera to your prompt, but does not guarantee the actual effect.
false: does not fix the camera.

watermark boolean Default value: false Abbreviation: wm
Specifies whether to add watermarks to the output video. Valid values:
false: does not add watermarks.
true: adds watermarks.
